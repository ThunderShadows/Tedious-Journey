# Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

# For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

# Increase the height of the tower by K
# Decrease the height of the tower by K
# Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

# Examples :

# Input: k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
# Output: 5

# Input: k = 3, arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
# Output: 11

# Time Complexity: O(n) and Space Complexity: O(1)
